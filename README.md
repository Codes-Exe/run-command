# Set up MATLAB

Execute a MATLAB script, function, or statement. MATLAB exits with exit code 0
if the specified script, function, or statement executes successfully without
error. Otherwise, MATLAB terminates with a nonzero exit code, which causes the
build to fail. You can use the assert or error functions in the command to
ensure that builds fail when necessary. When you use this task, all of the
required files must be on the MATLAB search path.

This is a placeholder README. The final README is currently be written (as it is
also the documentation).
